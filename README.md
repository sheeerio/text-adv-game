# My Personal Project

## 12 Minutes.

- What will the application **do**?

The application will be a minimalist text-based
adventure game that allows players to make choices
and interact with the story using button-based
interactions.

**Start**: The player wakes up in an unfamiliar place with
no memory of how they got there. They quickly realize
that they are in a time loop and must find a way to break
free.

**Early Progress**: The player explores the area and finds
objects and clues that will help them understand the 
situation and find a way to escape the time loop. As they
progress, the player begins to notice patterns and 
realizes that the time loop happens every 12 minutes 
(1 game day).

**Mid-game**: The player starts to uncover more details
about the time loop, such as what triggers it and who 
or what is behind it. They use this knowledge to try 
different approaches to break the loop and to avoid
making the same mistakes over and over again.

**End-game**: The player makes a breakthrough and 
discovers the key to breaking the time loop. The player's
choices and actions determine whether they are able
to break free and what the outcome of the game will be.

Throughout the game, the player must balance 
their resource management and puzzle solving to 
progress and escape the time loop. Most interactions 
will lack dialogues and exposition. The story will 
rely on environment cues. The gradual 
uncovering of the story and the player's sense of 
urgency to escape the loop add to the suspense and 
challenge of the game.

This is heavily inspired by games such as 
**A Dark Room**, **Minecraft**, and **CandyBox**.

- **Who** will use it?

The application will be used by people who enjoy 
text-based adventure games and are looking for a 
unique and immersive gaming experience. It will also
be suitable for people who appreciate minimalistic 
design and enjoy games that allow them to make 
choices and affect the outcome of the story.

- Why is this project of *interest* to **you**?

This project is of interest to me because I have a 
passion for creating interactive and engaging gaming 
experiences. I am also interested in minimalistic 
design and the concept of creating a unique 
experience for each player through multiple endings. 
Additionally, I believe text-based adventure games 
are an underappreciated genre, and I am excited to 
contribute to its resurgence in popularity.
