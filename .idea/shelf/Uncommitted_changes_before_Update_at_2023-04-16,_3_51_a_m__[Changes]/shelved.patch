<+># My Personal Project\n\n## 12 Minutes.\n\n- What will the application **do**?\n\nThe application will be a minimalist text-based\nadventure game that allows players to make choices\nand interact with the story using button-based\ninteractions.\n\n**Start**: The player wakes up in an unfamiliar place with\nno memory of how they got there. They quickly realize\nthat they are in a time loop and must find a way to break\nfree.\n\n**Early Progress**: The player explores the area and finds\nobjects and clues that will help them understand the \nsituation and find a way to escape the time loop. As they\nprogress, the player begins to notice patterns and \nrealizes that the time loop happens every 12 minutes \n(1 game day).\n\n**Mid-game**: The player starts to uncover more details\nabout the time loop, such as what triggers it and who \nor what is behind it. They use this knowledge to try \ndifferent approaches to break the loop and to avoid\nmaking the same mistakes over and over again.\n\n**End-game**: The player makes a breakthrough and \ndiscovers the key to breaking the time loop. The player's\nchoices and actions determine whether they are able\nto break free and what the outcome of the game will be.\n\nThroughout the game, the player must balance \ntheir resource management and puzzle solving to \nprogress and escape the time loop. Most interactions \nwill lack dialogues and exposition. The story will \nrely on environment cues. The gradual \nuncovering of the story and the player's sense of \nurgency to escape the loop add to the suspense and \nchallenge of the game.\n\nThis is heavily inspired by games such as \n**A Dark Room**, **Minecraft**, and **CandyBox**.\n\n- **Who** will use it?\n\nThe application will be used by people who enjoy \ntext-based adventure games and are looking for a \nunique and immersive gaming experience. It will also\nbe suitable for people who appreciate minimalistic \ndesign and enjoy games that allow them to make \nchoices and affect the outcome of the story.\n\n- Why is this project of *interest* to **you**?\n\nThis project is of interest to me because I have a \npassion for creating interactive and engaging gaming \nexperiences. I am also interested in minimalistic \ndesign and the concept of creating a unique \nexperience for each player through multiple endings. \nAdditionally, I believe text-based adventure games \nare an underappreciated genre, and I am excited to \ncontribute to its resurgence in popularity.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a user, I want to be able to add items to my inventory\n- As a user, I want to be able to remove items from my inventory\n- As a user, I want to be able to craft recipes from my inventory items\n- As a user, I want to be able to kill enemies\n- As a user, I want to be able to eat food \n- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of my current items in inventory\n- As a user, I want to be able to save my current progress as inventory and player stats\n- As a user, I want to be able to load my previous progress as inventory and player stats\n- As a user, I want to be able to interact with entities (NPCs) via given options\n- As a user, I want to be able to interact with miscellaneous items in my inventory\n- As a user, I want to be able to change the display mode of the game (light mode/dark mode)\n- As a user, I want to be able to change the sound option (mute/sound on)\n- As a user, I want to be able to view buttons I cannot click due to lack of experience or items\n- As a user, I want to be able to load my previous game progress\n\n## Instructions for grader\n- To generate the action of adding X's (wood) to a Y (inventory) select the to \"Leave\" the talk with the guard and then\n select \"Go north\" and then \"Chop wood\".\n- To view the added X (wood or wooden Plank), click \"Open inventory\" which opens a new window to showcase the current\n inventory.\n- To perform the action of selecting the current item, click on one of the items and then click done.\n- The current item is displayed on the player panel.\n- You can save the state of the inventory by clicking on the \"save\" button on the top right-hand side of the player\n panel.\n- You can reload the state of the inventory by clicking \"Load game\" at the start menu\n- The visual component of my application is the background of the game\n\n## Phase 4: Task 2\n\nAn example of what the logs look like at the end of the program is given below.\n\n**Note**: this is only an excerpt from the complete log list.\n\n`Wed Apr 12 16:28:24 PDT 2023\nAdded item: Raw Meat to inventory.`\n\n`Wed Apr 12 16:28:24 PDT 2023\nRemoved 1 item(s): Raw Meat from inventory.`\n\n`Wed Apr 12 16:28:34 PDT 2023\nSet current item to: Wooden Planks.`\n\n`Wed Apr 12 16:28:55 PDT 2023\nSet current item to: Wooden Sword.`\n\n`Wed Apr 12 16:28:56 PDT 2023\nAdded item: Wooden Planks to inventory.`\n\n`Wed Apr 12 16:29:15 PDT 2023\nSet current item to: Wooden Sword.`\n\n`Wed Apr 12 16:30:01 PDT 2023\nAdded item: Gold to inventory.`\n\n`Wed Apr 12 16:30:01 PDT 2023\nSet current item to: Gold.`\n`\n\n## Phase 4: Task 3\n\n![uml](data/uml.png)\n*UML diagram*\n\nGiven the resources, I would implement the following ideas into my code:\n- Refactoring the GUI into smaller, more cohesive classes helps to increase maintainability and extendability by\n  separating responsibilities and making modifications to one class independent of the rest.\n\n- Creating more methods with a single responsibility and purpose to help increase the readability and maintainability\n  of the code.\n\n- Using more abstract classes and interfaces to reduce repeated code and provide a common structure for multiple\n  classes to implement, resulting in more efficient and modular code.\n
